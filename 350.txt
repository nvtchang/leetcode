Given two integer arrays nums1 and nums2, return an array of their intersection.
Each element in the result must appear as many times as it shows in both arrays and you may return the result in any order.

Ex: Input: nums1 = [1,2,2,1], nums2 = [2,2]

my 1st approach: (づ ◕‿◕ )づ
1. loop nums1 
2. assign a value element to nums[i]
3. loop nums2
4. if the nums2[j] same as value, push to the result array
=> work but duplicate [ 2, 2, 2, 2 ]  (●´⌓`●)

my 2nd approach: ꒰(･‿･)꒱
1. assign first value of nums1 and nums2 to value and value1
2. if value === value1 => push to result array
3. else go to 2 loop of each arrays
=> not working Ⴚტ⊙▂⊙ტჂ
